<h2 id="swimming-tasmania-policies">Swimming Tasmania Policies</h2>

<p>As a minimum, all HC Swim Club Members should be aware of (and review) Swimming Tasmania&rsquo;s policies with regard to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code of Conduct</li>
<li>Member Welfare</li>
<li>Child Welfare</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access copies of these policies <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10K339DjX5Z2mdjPPmb4e0Yz4p-bhs1Yi/view" title="Swimming Australia Child Welfare Policy">here</a>.</p>

<p>Member Protection Information Officers (MPIO) - Head Coach, Members of the Committee</p>

<h1 id="conduct-of-swimmers-and-parents">Conduct of swimmers and parents</h1>

<p>It is expected that swimmers will display a high standard of behavior when associated with the Club - training, swim meets and social functions.
Swimmers must at all times respond to the Coach’s instructions and those of officials in charge of travelling teams. Please remember we would like our Club to be held in high regard and any lapse in behavior, by any member, on any occasions, detracts from that aim.
Cases of extremely bad behavior will be brought before the Club Committee and, in the worst case, expulsion from the Club may occur.</p>

<p>The Club’s policy is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A high standard of team spirit and consideration towards other members is expected of all swimmers and their parents.</li>
<li>Parents are encouraged to promote a sporting approach in which participation is valued and effort is acknowledged.</li>
<li>Intimidation, harassment or bullying by any member will not be tolerated in the Club.</li>
<li>Any concerns in this regard should be raised with the Head Coach or a Committee member at first occurrence.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="role-of-parents-guardians">Role of parents/guardians</h1>

<p>Swimmers need their parents to be very supportive if they are to succeed in this sport. They will also need additional assistance at swimming events and when the Club team travels to swim meets.
The following behaviors are expected of parents/guardians:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage your child to participate in sport for their enjoyment, personal satisfaction and improvement.</li>
<li>Focus on your child’s effort and performance, rather than winning or losing.</li>
<li>Appreciate good performance by all participants, and be supportive of all children who swim with the Club.</li>
<li>Never ridicule or yell at your child for making a mistake or performing below expectation.</li>
<li>Show appreciation and respect for all people involved in your child’s swimming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parent support is also a key ingredient to the success of the Club.  There are numerous ways parents can provide support, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assistance with organised Club activities</li>
<li>Joining the Club Committee</li>
<li>Swim Meet Volunteers (e.g. timekeepers</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="dealing-with-concerns-about-coaching">Dealing with concerns about coaching</h1>

<p>The Club Committee is responsible for appointing the Head Coach. The appointment of other coaches, decisions about the training program and competition, and all other matters relating to coaching are the responsibility of the Head Coach.
Like all other competitive sports, swimming attracts its fair share of armchair experts. Whilst the Committee encourages feedback and comment on the performance of coaches, it requires that feedback be provided in a constructive manner.
If you have a concern, the Committee encourages you to raise the matter with the Head Coach in the first instance. If you are dissatisfied with the Head Coach’s response, then speak to the Club President.
The Committee meets monthly and all concerns will be treated confidentially.</p>

<h1 id="social-media-guidelines">Social media guidelines</h1>

<p>These are the official guidelines for all social media activity at HC Swim Club. This policy is effective for all coaches, members and swimmers creating or contributing to blogs, social networks (Facebook, instagram etc) or any other kinds of social media.</p>

<h1 id="rules-of-engagement">Rules of engagement</h1>

<ul>
<li>Be respectful – respect the rights, dignity and worth of others. Your comments will be quickly noticed in the social media environments.</li>
<li>Write what you know – make sure you write and post about areas of your expertise. For example, parents or swimmers should not be making remarks on coaches or training techniques via social media.</li>
<li>Respect your Club – What you write reflects back on your club &hellip; do your Club proud.</li>
<li>Your responsibility – what you post is ultimately your responsibility, so please treat it seriously and with respect.</li>
<li><strong>HC Swim Club views Cyber bullying as extremely serious. The Committee will follow up complaints of bullying, harassment, intimidation and victimisation by any and all members.</strong></li>
