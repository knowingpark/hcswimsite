<h3 id="how-to-join-hc-swim-club">How to Join HC Swim Club</h3>

<h2 id="memberships-swimming-season">Memberships &amp; Swimming Season</h2>

<p>Club membership is annual (1 Oct – 30 Sep) and is aligned with Swimming Tasmania (STAS) registration. This means that there is one annual registration/renewal process which includes both the Club and STAS membership.
Club membership and STAS membership are compulsory for all squad members as this ensures that both the Club and swimmers are insured.
The swimming year is split into 2 seasons: Summer (Long Course) and Winter (Short Course).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-join-3-step-process">How to Join (3 Step Process)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Squad assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>All new swimmers are assessed (based on age and experience) by a Club Coach and assigned to the relevant training squad based on that assessment for trial. Contact the Collegiate Pool (phone 6211 4919) directly and request “a trial for HC Swim Club”.  Junior Racers are exempt from trials.</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete your trial</li>
</ul>

<p>Swimmers will be invited to have up to 3 trial sessions with the nominated squad within a 1-week period. Please note that a $15.00 fee applies.
HC Swim Club Trial Application Form must be completed (as provided by our Coaching Staff) on commencement of your trial.</p>

<p>​
*Note: The Club membership fees are reduced quarterly on a pro-rata basis for new swimmers. For example, if you join in May, you will pay 50% of the above Club membership fee for the first year. This applies to the Club component only. The Swimming Tasmania component of Club membership fees are only discounted for Winter Season “New Joiners” (as instructed by Swimming Tasmania).</p>
