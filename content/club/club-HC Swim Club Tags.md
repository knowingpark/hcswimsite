"The HC Swim Club provides a skills level structure which effectively starts where the Learn to Swim levels finish and takes swimmers up to Elite level.

Each level (Aquatic 9 to 14) require swimmers to obtain and demonstrate effective and consistent application of specific skills (stroke and racing) supporting their own development as a swimmer. All swimmers will be assesses on scheduled Assessment Days (or Tag Sessions) based on the required for each of the levels. By the end of each season all swimmers will be awarded their starting level, and in future sessions they will progress up the level structure as their skills improve. 

The 'Tag' refers to the intention of giving every swimmer a bag tag with their level on it, (rather like getting a green, brown or black belt in judo).

The coaching plan set out by the coaches will be focused on developing the required skills for both Junior and Senior swimmers alike.

For example:
Skills required for first level, Aquatic 9 (White Tag) includes:

* Backstroke finish using stroke count
* dive push - feet together, head first off side of pool
* black T and tumble turn
* ....and so on
     
whereas the highest level, Aquatic 14 (Gold Tag) includes:

* track start dive and 4 dolphin kicks to reach 15m
* 400m Dolphin Kick in less than 8 minutes
* Freestyle and Backstroke turns, streamline, 4 Dolphin Kicks to reach 10m
* ....and so on

A real benefit of our system is that the focus is on the skill development, not just 'time improvement', which is often the case in swimming. Times will improve as a result of improving skills and efficiency. This system will provide direct feedback to each swimmer in the areas they need to work on and what that are doing well in.

AQUATIC 9 - WHITE
